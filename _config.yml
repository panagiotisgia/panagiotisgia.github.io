user_description: I firmly believe that numbers have an important story to tell. They rely on us to give them a clear and convincing voice. So, let them talk and extract all the valuable insights. With the pursuit of a MSc in Data Science and the inherent curiosity I build my confidence to solve bigger and bigger problems everyday. Currently interested in Big Data tools and blockchain analytics.
